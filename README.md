## News

The repository is still under construction.

Examples of the first chapters for OpenGL and OpenGL Shader Language are included.
Also one very simple Vulkan Example.

### TODO:
Text and more Examples will follow.  
Instructions will also follow.

## What is needed for this?

This examples explains various aspects of the OpenGL 4.x and/or Vulkan graphics API, which are all open and multiplatform.
Therefore, in order to run or implement them, OpenGL 4.6 and/or Vulkan 1.0 must be available on the target platform (including operating systems, graphics drivers and platforms).

This means, the following requirements must be met:

- Graphics hardware (graphics card or integrated GPU) and drivers must support at least OpenGL 4.6 and Vulkan 1.0.
- As operating system Microsoft Windows (version currently supported by Microsoft) or Linux (for example Ubuntu LTS 20.04 or newer) can be used.
Note that the code has been tested with a graphics card and drivers supporting [OpenGL][] 4.6 and [Vulkan] 1.1 on Windows 10 / Linux (64-bit versions only).
- Since [Java][] is used, a [Java][] SDK Version 11 is also required.
- For all examples [Apache Maven 2][] is used for software project management.
- Github is used as source repository. To get the code, use git clone or download and unpack it. This requires Git or a Browser and a zip utility.
- An active Internet connection is required to set up all things.

An IDE is recommended for reviewing or changing the source, [Eclipse Java IDE][Eclipse] is preferred.

## Tests

The code has been tested with [OpenGL][] 4.6 and/or [Vulkan][] 1.1 on:
* Windows 10 / Linux (64-bit versions only)
* Java 11.0.7 [SapMachine][] (only 64bit Versions avaiable)
* [Eclipse 2020-06 IDE for Enterprise Java Developers][Eclipse]

As well as using the GitHub workflow Java CI with Maven on:
* Ubuntu Linux (latest Version)
* Java 11
